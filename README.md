## ‚öôÔ∏è Compatibility

Pre-built one-click releases can be found on our [releases](https://github.com/Q-Vault/qvault/releases) page. We officially support:

* Windows - .exe NSIS installer
* Mac OS - .dmg installer
* Linux - .AppImage

We also want to give a special thanks to [XDaemonX](https://github.com/XdaemonX) for maintaining the Arch Linux (AUR) package which can be found at: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/qvault/

Some linux distros don't support unprivileged CLONE_NEWUSER, without that, the electron
sandbox won't work. Since security is our #1 priority, we will not be disabling the sandbox; however, if you wish to
run Qvault on an unsupported distro, you can use the `--no-sandbox` flag.

## üëè Contributing

We love help! Contribute by forking the repo and opening pull requests. Please ensure that your code passes the existing tests, and write tests to test your changes if applicable.

All pull requests should be submitted to the "master" branch. Code in the "prod" branch is live in the latest release.

### Quickstart

#### Clone and enter the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/q-vault/qvault
cd qvault
```

#### Install dependencies

We use yarn as opposed to npm due it being recommended by most electron tools.

```bash
yarn install
```

#### Run development application

```bash
yarn dev
```

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Server

Users can choose to optionally store their encrypted vault on Qvault's servers. The API that Qvault uses is hosted at https://api.qvault.io

The only version of Qvault at any moment that is guaranteed to work nicely with the cloud server is the latest release,
although we do our best to maintain backwards compatibility. Please update accordingly.

In the future we plan to open source the server code and allow users to change their host address within the app.

### Linting and Styling

Qvault uses eslint and all pull requests must pass the eslint tests. Make sure your code adheres to the rules defined in [.eslintrc.json](.eslintrc.json)

To run the linting tests:

```bash
yarn lint
```

To try to autofix the repo:

```bash
yarn lint-fix
```

Some general rules that Qvault follows additionaly:

* All javascript filenames, functions, and variables are camelCase
* All vue filenames and components are PascalCase

### Node Version - NVM

NVM, or node version manager, is used to keep track of the supported node version. If you are having strange node api errors, be
sure to set the correct node version:

```bash
nvm use
```

### üß™ Run Tests

Mocha Chai

```bash
yarn test
```

## üî® Build from source

Building from source is the best way to ensure code integrity, but keep in mind auto-updates will not work.

```bash
yarn release --publish never
```

## Helpful VSCode settings

These are the repo-level settings some of us use in vscode. We also recommend using the eslint plugin by Dirk Baeumer.

```json
{
    "editor.formatOnSave": false,
    "files.eol": "\n",
    "eslint.validate": [
        {
            "language": "vue",
            "autoFix": true
        },
        {
            "language": "javascript",
            "autoFix": true
        }
    ],
    "eslint.autoFixOnSave": true
}
```
